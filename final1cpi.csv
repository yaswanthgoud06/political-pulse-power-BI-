11,https://twitter.com/cpimspeak/status/1775472088276402185#m,Stop Communalising Sainik Schools  The Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) notes with deep concern the report that the BJP-led Union government has facilitated the participation of private players to run Sainik Schools in India.  Sainink Schools have been traditionally run by the autonomous Sainik School Society under the Ministry ofÂ  Defence. The Sainik Schools play an important role in nurturing students to get entry to the premiere National Defence Academy and the Indian Naval Academy. Eventually a substantial number of Sainik School pass outs occupy the higher echelons of Indiaâ€™s defence forces.  This new policy is just not about sharing finances and infrastructure on a PPP model. The schools that are entering into agreement with SSS and the government include a significant number of institutions with avowedly RSS and BJP links.  The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) condemns this move which reinforces the trend of communalising education and potential for profoundly impacting the high secular standards of our military establishments. The Polit Bureau demands that the government must withdraw this move to ensure the national and secular character of the Sainik Schools is maintained.,CPI (M),"Apr 3, 2024 Â· 10:35 AM UTC",620,13,288,18
